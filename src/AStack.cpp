 * Implement the Stack abstraction using a fixed sized array.  This
 * array based implementation will dynamically allocate a new block of
 * memory once the current allocation becomes full.  The new block is
 * double in size of the old.  Thus push at the end of the stack
 * can be O(1) in most cases, but will take O(n) copies as well as a
 * memory allocation if it needs to grow.
