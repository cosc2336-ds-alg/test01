 *
 * Implement the Stack abstraction using a linked stack of dynamically
 * allocated node items.  The linked stack based implementation
 * creates new nodes dynamically when items are pushed onto the
 * stack, and deletes these nodes when the value is popped back off.
 * The Node structure defined in the Node.hpp header file is used
 * by this stack and is private to this stack member functions.
 * We use the top (front) of the linked stack to push items onto
 * and pop off of the stack since both operations are naturally
 * constant time O(1) to implement with a linked stack.
